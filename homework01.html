    <ol>
      <li>
        Copy the <a href="hello_mpi.cpp.html">hello_mpi.cpp</a> program to
        <kbd>pleiades</kbd> and make sure you can compile and run it.  There
        is nothing to turn in for this step, but it is recommended to make
        sure you can compile and run MPI programs successfully.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write an MPI program named <kbd>hello_name.cpp</kbd> which does the
        following:
        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>
            Ask the user to enter his name.  You may limit the input to 100
            characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Send the user name from the root process to each other MPI process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each process (including the root process) should
            print <code>Hello, <var>name</var>, from process <var>N</var>!</code>
            where <var>name</var> is the name entered by the user
            and <var>N</var> is the rank of the process.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <em>Note:</em> You send a string just as an array of characters.  In
        this case, the <code>buffer</code> parameter would be a pointer to
        the start of the array, the <code>type</code> parameter would be
        MPI_CHAR, and the <code>count</code> character would be the number
        of characters you are sending.  (Don't forget the null character.)
        <p>
          For example, you could send a C-string like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush:cpp">
char name[100] = "Suzy";

MPI_Send(name, 100, MPI_CHAR, destination, tag, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
</pre>
       </li>
      <li>Write an MPI program maned <kbd>avg_dist.cpp</kbd> which determines
        the average distance of a group of experimental numbers from a target
        number.  For example, if our experimental numbers are <kbd>{ 4, 11, 18
        }</kbd> and our target number is <kdb>10</kdb>, then the average
        distance is <kbd>(6 + 1 + 8) / 3 = 5</kbd>.
        <p>
          You must solve this problem as follows:
        </p>
        <ul class="spaced">
          <li>
            The user should first input the target number.  (Do not print a
            prompt; let's assume the user knows what he is doing.)
          </li>
          <li>
            After that, the user should enter as many experimental numbers as
            there are processes.  (You are programmers; you should be able to
            whip a program that spits out random numbers.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The root process should send each other process the target number
            and one experimental number.  (It will need to keep one for
            itself.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Each other process should then calculate the distance from its
            experimental number to the target number and send it back to the
            root process.  (The distance should always be positive.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The root process should average the results and then print out the
            answer.  (I couldn't think of anything to put in parentheses for
            this one.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
